Data Model

	body
	belongsTo 	User

	body

	belongsTo Sender
	belongsTo TopicOwner	
	belongsTo Topic
	
User - DONE
	name
	Relationships:
		hasMany Identities
		hasMany Topics
		hasMany Replies
		
Identity - DONE
	identityType (Email, Phone Number, Twitter, etc)
	identityValue (the way the user is identified on this channel: e.g @nicktmro on Twitter provider)
	Relationships:
		hasMany 	Topics
		belongsTo	User
		
		
Concepts:

- unique user identifier: Phone number, email address, twitter handle, etc

Topic#TopicOwner is redundant as I can navigate to it via the Topic itself.
